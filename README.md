# RIZE
Rize is a study tool that allows users to upload lecture transcripts or research papers and outputs a summary of the content using a modified pretrained BERT model. It also outputs the key concepts of the lecture using IBM Watson's API as well as relevant images using SerpApi. The backend uses FastAPI which is connected to a React frontend.
